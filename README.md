# SimpleWebAPI
Angular Front End, .Net Core and SQL DB


To Run: 
1. Ensure SQL database is installed correctly. (https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/sql-server/sql-server-downloads). I recommend installing Postman for API troubleshooting as well (https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Run SQL query included to create the database and required tables.
2. Open webapi/webapi.sln in Visual Studio and run. API calls should be displayed via Swagger if everything is running smooth.
3. Open a new command prompt and cd into ui/BuilderUI and then run 'ng serve'
4. The angular front end should launch and be ready for use. (Note: Firefox was displaying a CORS error, so Chrome was used for testing).
